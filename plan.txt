reconcile this independent repo, with the validation branch and folder in rocker-versions2.

Produce a basic report 

0)  delete all previous output.
a) test base installation and packages
b) test recommended packages

c)  the extra packages shipped by default in cctu-rocker.  This uses extra_package_test.R and test_pkg.R  to grab teh extra test files and run them. The rockker default doesn't
install tests..

d) This should then be intended to be run on each persons docker installation.   The github version will .gitignore the output files, but shoudl be kept on users' versions.

e)  Make it work on github via a workflow. Install rocker version xx, run teh validations,  output report  to the wiki directory? Do somethign clever each day to check if a new version has come out/rebuild the latest/ or repeat if its' not there.

f)  Go to R_validation riskassessment/riskmetric.  Build reports for each package.

Maybe use blogdown  with  build.R option.  You coudl then render individual package and the basic tests, using seperate pages,  and write teh results/datestampe to an R object.  Build an index file that presents an overall table of outputs. Give flexibility to re-run failed scripts.. Maybe use parallel processing...  

Check up is .md the actual output after running R code. Or just another variation on Rmd..
